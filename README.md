Many people benefit for a practice of taking notes. Notes may be of short term relevance
or may be important to commit to long term memory such as advice, wisdom or influential
experiences that you learned from. This "applet" simply reads from a list of notes that
you create in CSV format and shows you a new one everyday. It is designed with the intent
that a user would place a shortcut to the DailyNote.pyw in their Windows startup folder
so that each time you start up your computer and login, it displays the note of the day.

Limitation of current version--
    Right now it will only properly cycle through as many notes as there are days of the
    year. If you were to add more than notes than days of the year, then at the end of
    the year, it would restart at the first note instead of continuing down the list.
    I'm still transcribing notes from my notepad into the notes.csv file and when I reach
    365 notes, I will create a fix.

Possible future upgrades--
    Randomize the note number selected
    Allow for more than 365 notes
    Change the file reading process so that it doesnt have to read the entire notes.csv
        into memory before selection the row to display.
