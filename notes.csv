#### Use double quotes for notes that have commas or they will be cut off ####

*Add your notes to this notes.csv file with each note on a new row and store the file
in the same directory as the DailyNote.pyw file. Add a shortcut of the DailyNote file
to your startup folder to see the note when you startup your computer. Don't forget to
delete these lines but leave the top line. The program will begin from line 2.*
